To run the code and generate coverage reports, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. Make sure you have the latest version
   of Flutter SDK installed on your machine.

2. Set up your project:
    * Create a new Flutter project or use an existing one.
    * Replace the code in the relevant files (main.dart, api_call.dart, articles_provider.dart,
      etc.) with the updated code provided.

3. Set up the necessary packages:
    * Open the pubspec.yaml file of your Flutter project.
    * Add the following packages under the dependencies section:
        * dependencies:
          flutter:
          sdk: flutter
          provider: ^5.0.0
          http: ^0.13.3
          cached_network_image: ^3.0.0
        * Save the pubspec.yaml file.
        * Run the command flutter pub get to fetch the packages and update your project.

4. Run the app:
    * Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
    * Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator.
    * Run the command flutter run to launch the app on the device/emulator.

5. Verify the app behavior:
    * The app should start and display a list of most popular articles.
    * When you tap on an article, it should attempt to launch the corresponding URL.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the code.
